            Due to a lack of additional funding from Congress, the Affordable
            Connectivity Program has ended for now. Effective June 1, 2024,
            households will no longer receive an ACP discount.

              The Affordable Connectivity Program is an FCC benefit program that
              helps ensure that households can afford the ACP broadband they
              need for work, school, healthcare, and more. The ACP benefit
              provides a discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service
              for eligible households and up to $75 per month for households on
              qualifying Tribal lands. Eligible households can also receive a
              one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop
              computer, or tablet from participating providers if they
              contribute more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase
              price. The Affordable Connectivity Program is limited to one
              monthly service discount and one device discount per household.
